# NBA-Win-Projection-Model
A model to simulate NBA seasons with lineup performance data, and evaluate the effect of a play-in game if the NBA decides to take that route. The code scrapes opening lineups via RealGM, does a simple estimate of offensive and defensive ratings powered by Jacob Goldstein's Player Impact Plus-Minus, predicts the likelihood of the home team winning based on ratings, rest, and travel distance, and is simulated 10,000 times.
